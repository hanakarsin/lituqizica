His story is about legal struggle, which beginned in 2011. He even tried to appeal but failed. This man delivered teen girls of 17-21 years from Lagos to Mali as prostitutes. He was brought to the Federal High Court in Lagos by NAPTIP. After many appeals and the dismiss, he was condemned and sentenced. Ezekiel was already behind bars for the same actual criminal act, so we can’t be sure that this time he will understand the lesson.

The victim was kept against her will at a brothel in Rossetenville and was forced to see in average six clients per night. This place in Johannesburg is a problem area, where sexual exploration can be met across-the-board, there are many alcoholics and drug abused. The abuse became a trauma for the entire life and victim’s mother fears for the life of her daughter, because many friends of the sentenced are still free and can revenge their friend. The National Prosecuting Authority considers this case as a reason for hope of the residents of the country for justice.

Everything begins form the criminal trader, who promises a life of higher level to his future "goods". Parents themselves persuade their blood and soul to sell themselves, and they readily agree because the seller promises an outstanding income, opportunity to receive education and other goods of civilization. It is far from case. Each year, more than 500,000 young women from Nigeria illegally go to brothels in Europe. The crossing to Europe is like a nightmare - illegal immigrants are transported on brittle boats to the shores of Spain and Italy. People, who could survive the road, faced unpleasant opening that they now have to trade their bodies on the street. Years in a row, the Government of Nigeria together with the church have opened few shelters for people who were too naive and became the victims of human trafficking.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/b25ee50d14588925.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Rat becomes a hero, first to be awarded gold medal because it did this thing (see photos)</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Thousands of females, who became targets of human smugglers in West African countries, including Nigeria, are now in Europe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt1mr89i6m2uk8.jpeg><p class=align-left>UNODC estimates that West African victims of traffickers, mostly in Nigeria, account for almost ten percent of women who are forced into sex trade in Western Europe.</p><p class=align-left>A major role in Nigeria's trafficking is played by the city of Benin City in southern Nigeria, where there is a branching network of trafficking.</p><p class=align-left>There, traffickers of human commodity are looking for girls who are attracted by bright perspectives of work or education abroad.
