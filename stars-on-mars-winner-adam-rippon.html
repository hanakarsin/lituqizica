In the earlier episodes, he was placed in the bottom three after several challenges, noting that he "did deserve it."</p><p>"It was so chaotic and it was so crazy," Adam explained, detailing his first challenge. "It was in a dust storm and there's like dust coming up through the top, like, it was so crazy that I was thinking, 'Oh, they're gonna say cut, we're going to reset. They're going to just start this over like this can't be right.' So I stopped doing everything.

"But it was a set and on the outskirts are like all the cameras and the whole crew."</p><p>"I think the hardest part was like, you know, people are messy," he continued. "And, you know, I think some of these people on the show are, like, so rich that, I can imagine that they don't have to vacuum very often. [...] I like to clean and I like keeping everything orderly.
