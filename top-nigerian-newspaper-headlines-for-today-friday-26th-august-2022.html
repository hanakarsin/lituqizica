the party and bringing all its leaders together.</p><p>The former Vice President made the call in a statement to Naija News signed by his Media Adviser, Paul Ibe in Abuja on Thursday.</p><p>According to the statement, “it has become imperative to appeal to all party members, leaders and everyone related to, connected with or associated with the presidential candidate of the PDP, Atiku Abubakar to desist from making comments that potentially reduce the optics of PDP’s image as a united political party.</p><p>Atiku pointed out that Nigerians are looking up to the PDP to lead the charge in ousting the ruling party, adding that this expectation from the people is the reason why the APC is jittery of their impending fall in next year’s general election.</p><p>He accused the ruling APC of manipulating the political process to create a sense of division in the PDP.</p><p>No politician in his right mind, according to the Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA), will siphon

State.</p><p>Speaking in an interview with Daily Trust, Lawal said the Muslim-Muslim ticket was discussed during the meeting.</p><p>According to him, the same religion ticket is existential and designed to oppress, kill and eliminate Christians in the North from the political and economic systems.</p><p>The former Governor of Kaduna State, Senator Ahmed Makarfi, has reacted to the meeting between the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Bola Tinubu and Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State.<br>Naija News had reported that Wike and Tinubu met in London on Monday night to discuss issues relating to the 2023 presidential election.</p><p>A source who spoke with Vanguard on the condition of anonymity revealed that the meeting was centred around how the Wike camp would stay in PDP to cause a crisis in the party.</p><p>Also speaking with Daily Trust, a source belonging to the Tinubu camp said the discussions were very fruitful, adding that Wike may reach agreements to support Tinubu and the APC in the 2023 elections.</p><p>The APC chieftain said it was also discussed during the meeting how they would mobilize their supporters to work for APC in

(Benue) and Seyi Makinde (Oyo) attended the meeting from the Wike camp.</p><p>Reacting to the development in a chat with The Punch, Makarfi said the meeting between Wike and some top chieftains of the
