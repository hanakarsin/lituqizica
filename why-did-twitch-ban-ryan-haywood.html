But why now?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Ryan Haywood was accused of multiple accounts of sexual assault prior to being fired from Rooster Teeth.</h2><p>On Oct. 6, multiple allegations emerged accusing Haywood of sexual assault, with some of the victims coming forward claiming they were minors at the time these incidents took place. Following the news of these allegations, Haywood said in a vague tweet on Twitter that he would be leaving Rooster Teeth "to focus on rebuilding" his family after making some "mistakes."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>"I'm sorry to anyone I've hurt. I do want to say emphatically that I never did anything illegal," he wrote at the time. "The consequences of my actions are mine to deal with, please stop harassing and threatening my family."</p><p>The influencer eventually deleted his Twitter following the backlash he received from the allegations.</p><p>"Our Code of Conduct is meant for everyone in our community to follow and that includes our staff and anyone who works or partners with Rooster Teeth," Rooster Teeth said in a statement on Twitter following Haywood's departure. "We have parted ways with two employees whose conduct did not reflect the values we strive to uphold in our Code of Conduct."</p><p>Since then, the creator has largely remained under the radar, though recently it appears he's been trying to rebuild an internet platform for himself.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Twitch has indefinitely suspended/permanently banned former Rooster Teeth personality Ryan Haywood, who returned to Twitch last week, following several allegations last year ranging from sexual abuse to statutory rape, per source.

But it wasn't long following the announcement that many began calling on Twitch to ban the player from its platform due to the allegations against him.

"Twitch's official statement to me: 'no comment.'"</p><p>Since Twitch declined to publicly comment on the decision, it's unclear why exactly he was removed from the platform now, though it seems very possible it's in connection with his prior allegations.</p><p><strong>If you need support, call the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1-800-656-4673 or visit </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>RAINN.org</strong></a><strong> to chat online one-on-one with a support specialist at any time.&nbsp;</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2asp57BpLSMm5inZaKurq95x5qwsKefmQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-did-twitch-ban-ryan-haywood.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-did-twitch-ban-ryan-haywood.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-did-twitch-ban-ryan-haywood.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-did-twitch-ban-ryan-haywood.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-did-twitch-ban-ryan-haywood.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-did-twitch-ban-ryan-haywood.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./why-was-pen15-canceled.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./why-was-pen15-canceled.html>Is Hulu's Hit Cringe Comedy Series 'Pen15' Being Prematurely Canceled?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./who-did-mollie-fitzgerald-play-in-captain-america.html>Who Did Mollie Fitzgerald Play in 'Captain America: The First Avenger'?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./who-did-mollie-fitzgerald-play-in-captain-america.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
