The hope of the younger generation is dashed. Our hospitals are rather described as graveyards right now. Our schools are closed and we have over 14 million children out of school.</p><p>“Today, you hear agitations for the dismemberment of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. Those agitations are coming from all sections of the country. The economy, I dare also say, is in shambles right now.</p><p>“All these put together are created by the type of leadership we have in the country. They are a result of how we have organized and managed ourselves. They were not made by God</p><p>“Therefore, looking at the challenges that we have, we conducted some polls across the nation, bearing in mind the circumstances that we are experiencing in the country.”</p><p>“We asked Nigerians: How do we get out of this quagmire? For me, Nigeria must remain united. There are no insurmountable problems, and cannot be resolved.</p><p>“So, if we want to resolve the matter, I am going to call on this Forum to, in the interest of this country and the generations yet unborn to make the necessary sacrifice and view the situation dispassionately and not based on sentiments.</p><p>“We have set out the criteria, and have identified the issues, and said that the kind of leadership we need in this country must be a courageous, fair, tested and proven leadership with cognate experience in the management of the affairs of the conclusion, rightly or wrongly, that the person that has the quality to unite Nigeria at this point in time is Waziri Atiku Abubakar.</p><p>“We must put a square peg in a square hole. We must not allow some people who want to disintegrate this country to succeed,” he said.</p><p>The media mogul maintained that he was supporting a northern presidency in the 2023 elections because they had been marginalised with the death of former President Umaru Musa Yar’ Adua in 2010.</p><p>Dokpesi argued that it will not be fair and just should power return to the South in 2023, even though the regime of President Muhammadu Buhari would have done eight years.</p><p>According to him, his support for the northern presidency was in line with the PDP agreement during the party’s convention in 2006.</p><p>He said, “2023 is still the turn of the North based on the PDP agreement and calculation. The records of the PDP are there. Some people said why should we bring a Fulani man again, and I said have we not been living with Fulani people? I was brought up by a Fulani man, Bamanga Tukur.</p><p>“Nigerians must unite and deal with elements brought into the country for destabilisation. We are here to plead and cry to the leaders of North Central not to relent in their sacrifices for the country.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ze49xZmtoYmh6tbTEZqWoqqSdeqmt1Z5km52Vo3qurdGgoKeZnJ7HprCMmquio6Visaa%2FxKutnqtdpb%2Bmv8idnKebqWKxsLfPnqqiZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f2023-the-north-have-been-marginalized-atiku-deserves-presidency-dokpesi.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f2023-the-north-have-been-marginalized-atiku-deserves-presidency-dokpesi.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f2023-the-north-have-been-marginalized-atiku-deserves-presidency-dokpesi.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f2023-the-north-have-been-marginalized-atiku-deserves-presidency-dokpesi.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f2023-the-north-have-been-marginalized-atiku-deserves-presidency-dokpesi.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f2023-the-north-have-been-marginalized-atiku-deserves-presidency-dokpesi.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./lacey-claire-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./lacey-claire-html.html>Lacey Claire - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./fake-bishops-tinubu-told-to-withdraw-from-presidential-race.html>Tinubu Told To Withdraw From Presidential Race</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./fake-bishops-tinubu-told-to-withdraw-from-presidential-race.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
