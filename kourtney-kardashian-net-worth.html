Following her parents' divorce in 1991, Kris re-married Olympic athlete Bruce Jenner (now <a href=#>Caitlyn</a>) and gained stepbrothers Burt and Brody, stepsister Casey, and half-sisters Kendall and Kylie.</p><p class="sc-ktvXtq dPyThM"><span>Kourtney Kardashian</span></p><p class="sc-fxFQrc gpgOkp">Media personality, Socialite, Founder of Poosh</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $65 Million</p><p>Kourtney Kardashian rose to fame in the early 2000s, alongside her sisters on the reality television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians.</p><p>Currently, Kourtney owns the lifestyle website Poosh and appears on Hulu's The Kardashians, a continuation of their reality TV series. After spending many years in a relationship with fellow socialite Scott Disick in 2015, the pair broke up. Kourtney is now married to blink-182 drummer Travis Barker.</p><p><strong>Birth date</strong>: Aug. 21, 1981</p><p><strong>Birth place</strong>: Los Angeles, Calif.</p><p><strong>Birth name</strong>: Kourtney Mary Kardashian</p><p><strong>Father</strong>: Robert Kardashian</p><p><strong>Mother</strong>: Kris Jenner (neé Kardashian)</p><p><strong>Marriages</strong>: Travis Barker (m. 2022—)</p><p><strong>Children</strong>: Mason Disick, Penelope Disick, Reign Disick</p><p><strong>Education</strong>: Marymount High School, Southern Methodist University, University of Arizona</p><p>After graduating high school, Kourtney is the only one of her sisters to attend college. She attended Southern Methodist University in Texas for two years before moving to Arizona and graduating from the University of Arizona with a bachelor's degree in Theatre Arts. Kourtney was first introduced on reality television after participating in 2005's Filthy Rich: Cattle Drive, in which she competed for money for charity.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Following the release of her sister Kim Kardashian's now-infamous sex tape, the Kardashian family began their reality series Keeping Up With the Kardashians. However, in addition to appearing on the show, Kourtney opened several different stores: Smooch, a children's clothing store co-operated with her mother, and DASH, an adult clothing store co-operated with Kim and Khloé.</p><p>Contrary to popular belief, Kourtney did eventually put her theatre degree to good use. In 2011, she appeared as attorney Kassandra Kavanaugh on the ABC soap opera One Life to Live. After appearing on the show, Kourtney realized she did not want to be an actress, telling <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People Magazine</a> at the time, "I'd thought I'd only have two lines. But my script is so long... I'm not an actress."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Although the Kardashian sisters have made money through a variety of endorsements, including skincare line PerfectSkin, QuickTrim health products (of which they were later sued for false advertising), jewelry lines, and Pretty Little Thing collaborations, each sister has since branched off into their business ventures. Kourtney has collaborated with both Kim and Kylie on perfume and makeup lines inspired by their sisterhood.</p><p>In 2019, Kourtney officially launched her wellness and lifestyle brand website, called Poosh. Although Kourtney does not currently have products of her own, she uses the website to provide recipes and endorse other wellness products.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Kourtney's overall net worth is an estimated $65 million. While her salary is listed at $10 million, Style Caster reports that each of the Kardashian-Jenner clan collect a whopping $16.6 million for each season of KUWTK. It is unclear if the majority of her net worth comes from the advertising on Poosh's website or her various product endorsements over the years, but all that endorsing is significantly paying off!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoLy2vtOnnLJlm5a%2Fpa3SoaCapl2jsrV51qipraBf</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkourtney-kardashian-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fkourtney-kardashian-net-worth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fkourtney-kardashian-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fkourtney-kardashian-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkourtney-kardashian-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkourtney-kardashian-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./2023-presidency-peter-obi-visits-seyi-makinde-in-ibadan.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./2023-presidency-peter-obi-visits-seyi-makinde-in-ibadan.html>Peter Obi Visits Seyi Makinde In Ibadan</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./kevin-hunter-html.html>Kevin Hunter - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./kevin-hunter-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
