In 2007, Jennifer and her mother, Darnell Donerson, attended the Oscars when Jennifer won Best Supporting Actress. The singer also had a close relationship with her brother, Jason Hudson, and her nephew, Julian King. Jennifer’s sister, Julia, gave birth to Julian in 2000.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>By 2008, Jennifer was fresh off her Oscars win and working on other films like the Sex and the City movie and The Secret Life of Bees. However, in October of that year, Jennifer faced another life-altering moment.</p><p>On Oct. 24, 2008, Jennifer’s family members — Darnell, Jason, and Julian — were murdered. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Today</a> reported they were killed by gunshots and found dead inside Darnell’s home. The murders shocked Jennifer’s fans and community, as her mother was a pillar in the family’s church.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Several weeks after the murders, law enforcement began investigating who was behind the crime. Police eventually arrested the singer’s brother-in-law, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">William Balfour</a>. Balfour, 27 at the time, allegedly took Julian from his room, stole Jason’s car, and shot his stepson multiple times.</p><p>In 2012, Jennifer publicly spoke about the murders for the first time on <a href=#>Oprah Winfrey</a>’s Oprah’s Next Chapter. On the show, Jennifer and Julia discussed protecting their loved ones’ legacies through their charity, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Julian D. King Gift Foundation</a>. Jennifer also admitted that she forgave Balfour for what he did to her village.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>“For the most part, it's not his fault," Jennifer said of her ex-brother-in-law, adding, "It's what he was taught, how he was brought up.”</p><p>Jennifer explained that, unlike Balfour, her mother’s values kept her or her family from making the same bad decisions he made.</p><p>“You never had a chance," she said of Balfour. "Had you had the love my mother gave us, or the background that some have, then you would've stood a chance."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">William Balfour believes his murder charges were a “conspiracy” against him.</h2><p>Julia and Balfour married in 2006, and he was her son’s stepfather. When they separated in 2008, the split escalated their already volatile relationship. Before police charged Balfour for the murder, he allegedly told his friends that he planned on killing Julia and her family.</p><p>Following his arrest, Balfour faced a jury in a Chicago trial. Jennifer and Julia attended each case and were there when Cook County Judge Charles Patrick Burns charged him with three consecutive life sentences for the killings of Darnell, Jason, and Julian. Balfour also received 120 years for aggravated kidnapping and home invasion.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Despite the lengthy sentence, some believed it wasn’t enough, and Judge Burns stated in court to Balfour: ​​"You have the heart of an arctic night. Your soul is as barren as dark space."</p><p>Years after the trial, Balfour maintained his innocence and described the charges as a “conspiracy.” He also claimed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ABC News</a>’ I-Team in 2016 that anyone could be responsible for the murders, which is what he would tell Jennifer himself if he ever saw her again. However, Chicago police have yet to reopen the case, and Balfour is still serving his prison sentence in Pontiac, Illinois.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGSjnZ6jtqex0WafrpyjpLtussCmoKWx</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-jennifer-hudson-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-happened-to-jennifer-hudson-family.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-jennifer-hudson-family.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-happened-to-jennifer-hudson-family.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-jennifer-hudson-family.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-jennifer-hudson-family.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kids-behind-bars-kristel-maestas.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kids-behind-bars-kristel-maestas.html>'Kids Behind Bars' Kristel Maestas: What Was Her Crime?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./moment-vice-president-shettima-offered-buhari-his-seat-at-event-video.html>Moment Vice President, Shettima Offered Buhari His Seat At Event (Video)</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./moment-vice-president-shettima-offered-buhari-his-seat-at-event-video.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
