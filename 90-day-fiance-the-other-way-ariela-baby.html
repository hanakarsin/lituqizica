On the show, Ariela is traveling from Princeton, N.J. to be with her boyfriend full-time in Ethiopia because she is pregnant with his baby and she wants him to be present for the birth.</p><p>Because the couple had only known one another for a few months before starting their family, Ariela's family is concerned about her rushing into the relationship. They're also worried that Biniyam wants to use her to go to the U.S., since he has a child with another American woman already. &nbsp;</p><p>Did <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">90 Day FiancÃ©: The Other Way star Ariela</a> have her baby?

She explained on the premiere episode how she and Biniyam got to know one another.&nbsp;</p><p>Before she met Biniyam, Ariela was married to a man from Argentina named Leandro for 10 years. After her divorce, she decided to book a cheap flight to Ethiopia. That's when she first encountered Biniyam.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TLC</span></figure><p>"I was waiting for a taxi outside a local hotel, and I saw a very attractive guy. I yelled out, 'don't I know you from somewhere?' And it actually worked," she said.</p><p>Ariela said that she tried to distance herself from Biniyam because she wasn't ready for a serious relationship. But, she found herself continuing to reach out to him.&nbsp;</p><p>"After dating for three months, I got some pretty unexpected news," she continued. "I found out I was pregnant. I'm six months pregnant with a baby boy."</p><p>After the first trimester of her pregnancy, Ariela returned to the U.S. to get prenatal care. Because Biniyam was unable to get a visa to go to the U.S., Ariela returned to Ethiopia to give birth.</p><p>Unfortunately for the couple, Ariela's family is skeptical of Biniyam's intentions, mainly because he had another relationship (and a child) with someone else.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Biniyam's ex-wife?</h2><p>Prior to meeting Ariela, Biniyam was married to a woman named Bria, who is originally from Iowa. The two met at a nightclub in November of 2014 after Bria had moved to the area to do service work.&nbsp;</p><p>Though there was a language barrier between the two, they fell in love. Bria explained the details of their love story to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hawk Eye</a> in 2017.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Hello My Friends, Today is my birthday!

He has such a serving heart and so itâ€™s neat that God really connected us knowing that we both have serving hearts..." she said. "I knew that he had a good heart and I could tell how good he was with his family, and thatâ€™s something that really meant a lot."</p><p>The two got married in June of 2016, when Bria was already pregnant.</p><p>They aimed to return to the U.S. in the fall of that year in order to attend Bria's sister's wedding. But, there were issues when it came to getting Biniyam a visa.</p><p>When Bria had an ultrasound in the States, she learned that her baby had gastroschisis, which is when the intestines grow on the outside of the body.&nbsp;</p><p>With this complication, it was evident for Bria that she would have to give birth at a hospital in the U.S. that specializes in repairing gastroschisis.</p><p>Eventually, after speaking with lawyers and lawmakers in Iowa, Biniyam applied for humanitarian parole. He was allowed to be by his wife's side when she gave birth, and the two welcomed a son named Simon in February of 2017.</p><p>Unfortunately, the marriage between Biniyam and Bria fell apart shortly after the birth of Simon. Biniyam often posts on Instagram about missing his baby boy. Bria has since gotten engaged to someone else.&nbsp;</p><p>90 Day FiancÃ©: The Other Way airs on Sundays at 8 p.m. ET on TLC.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfbn1usMCyZJ%2BhkaOwpnnToZxmp6SdsrN51pqwZpminrKtrYybmJux</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f90-day-fiance-the-other-way-ariela-baby.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f90-day-fiance-the-other-way-ariela-baby.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f90-day-fiance-the-other-way-ariela-baby.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f90-day-fiance-the-other-way-ariela-baby.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f90-day-fiance-the-other-way-ariela-baby.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f90-day-fiance-the-other-way-ariela-baby.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./332465-8-typical-year-resolutions-kenyan-break-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./332465-8-typical-year-resolutions-kenyan-break-html.html>8 typical new year resolutions every Kenyan is likely to make and break</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./251798-rais-mugabe-aandamana-na-watoto-na-wajukuu-wake-kulihudhuria-kongamano-la-ki-html.html>Rais Mugabe aandamana na watoto na wajukuu wake kulihudhuria kongamano la kitaifa</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./251798-rais-mugabe-aandamana-na-watoto-na-wajukuu-wake-kulihudhuria-kongamano-la-ki-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
