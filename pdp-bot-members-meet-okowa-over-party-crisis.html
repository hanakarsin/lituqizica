Like I said the last time, we have been going around and we met most of the governors.”</p><p>While speaking on the next step, Wabara said BoT members would meet with the party’s Presidential candidate, <strong>Atiku Abubakar</strong>, and Governor <strong>Nyesom Wike</strong> of Rivers State.</p><p>He said, “In the coming days, we will also meet with the principal, the Presidential candidate, former Vice President, Atiku Abubakar and from there we will proceed to meet with Governor Wike.</p><p>“We have met with some other governors, we have me Governor Samuel Ortom, Governor Seyi Makinde, Governor Seyi Makinde, Governor Ahmadu Fintri, Governor Ikpeazu and Ugwuanyi of Enugu State.</p><p>“We have what it takes to resolve this, and very soon we will resolve all these issues.“</p><p>In his remarks, Okowa commended the BoT members for their effort in resolving the crisis rocking the party, promising to support the reconciliation moves.</p><p>He said, “We are talking amongst ourselves as governors realizing that there are several leaders within our party from across the country. We’ve been talking with ourselves.</p><p>“I believe that they’re still a little work to be done but a lot has been done. We are largely reconciled. There are still issues to be dealt with. That’s why you see some of the leaders of the party the Board of Trustees here today.</p><p>“We have had very useful discussions on what they could do and what we ought to continue to do as a party.</p><p>“But, because the PDP is a very large party, we understand that yet, there is some level of disagreement, but we will continue to stay in touch with ourselves to resolve the issues.”</p><p>Okowa expressed hope that Governor Wike, Seyi Makinde (Oyo), Samuel Ortom (Benue), Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi (Enugu), Okezie Ikpeazu (Abia) and other aggrieved members would work for the success of the party in 2023.</p><p>He added: “Last Tuesday on the 27th we were in the southeast. Our brother, the governor of Enugu state, hosted us very well. That’s a very positive step forward.</p><p>“We had very useful interactions with all our leaders in the southeast and I think that is a great plus for us as a party.</p><p>“And I believe too that you’re aware, too that we were in the southwest where we were very well received by Governor Seyi Makinde and the stakeholders of the party.</p><p>“The few issues are still left on the table. I’m sure we’ll come to discuss it and in the next few days, we are convinced that will be largely reconciled.</p><p>“Governors and other members who are aggrieved are members of the party. I believe that my brothers would all work for the party, PDP is home and they belong to that home.</p><p>“They’re not going to destroy their home. So, we will allow it together. I do believe that we’ll continue to talk with ourselves and resolve the little issues that are left.“</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe49qZqmcoGKvsMCMppymmpWnwG65xJ6rZqebpMSiec6vnKtloJa%2FtcWMnKmiq5mofA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpdp-bot-members-meet-okowa-over-party-crisis.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fpdp-bot-members-meet-okowa-over-party-crisis.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fpdp-bot-members-meet-okowa-over-party-crisis.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fpdp-bot-members-meet-okowa-over-party-crisis.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpdp-bot-members-meet-okowa-over-party-crisis.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpdp-bot-members-meet-okowa-over-party-crisis.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./2023-why-i-wont-support-jonathan-if-he-contest-under-apc.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./2023-why-i-wont-support-jonathan-if-he-contest-under-apc.html>2023: Why I Wont Support Jonathan If He Contest Under APC</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./lance-armstrong-html.html>Lance Armstrong - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./lance-armstrong-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
