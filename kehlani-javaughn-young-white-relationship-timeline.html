Javaughn, comedian <a href=#>Jaboukie Young-White</a>'s brother, was Kehlani's guitarist. Both <a href=#>being members of the LGBTQ+ community</a>, they bonded over their shared experiences. Kehlani had previously identified as queer before coming out as a lesbian.</p><p>"He understands my queerness and my fluidity, and I understand him," they said during the interview. "It’s very awesome to be understood.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">They broke up soon after welcoming their daughter, Adeya, in March 2019.</h2><p>Kehlani and Javaughn often defended their relationship online, as some fans oddly wondered how the singer was pregnant when she previously dated women, though they've dated other cishet men before. Still, the couple were going strong and, in March 2019, welcomed their baby girl, Adeya, in a home birth. Javaughn and Kehlani both documented the happy news in separate social media posts, which have since been deleted.</p><p>After Adeya's birth, the pair broke up and never shared what led to the split.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">In 2021, Kehlani maintained she and Javaughn were “really close friends” and were co-parenting well.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@kehlani</a></figure><p>Although they didn't work out as a couple, Kehlani and Javaughn were in a positive place for their daughter. In 2021, the "After Hours" singer opened up about their co-parenting relationship with their ex on their Facebook Watch special, P<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ride On! Kehlani & Larry's Excellent Pride Ride</a>.</p><p>"Me and her dad are like really, really close friends," Kehlani said on the show, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pop Culture</a>. "And the decision to start a family was really easy for us because we both believed in each other's ability to be good parents."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">In August 2024 Javaughn filed for full custody and claimed Kehlani is in a cult.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by @javaughnyw</a></p></figure><p>Five years after the couple parted ways, Javaughn dropped multiple bombshells about his and Kehlani's once-solid co-parenting bond. In August 2024, court documents obtained by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> surfaced of him requesting full custody of their daughter and child support from Kehlani. Javaughn claimed the singer is in a cult and has left their child with "random strangers" to care for her while they're on tour. One of the strangers is allegedly a woman Kehlani calls "Messiah," who allegedly bathes with their daughter while under the influence of psychedelics.</p><p>Javaughn also alleged that Kehlani's cult leader had "numerous accusations of committing sexual assault" against women and young girls. He said that when he would express his concerns with Kehlani, she "resorts to disparaging me online to her millions of social media followers."</p><p>Several days after the filing went public, social media and multiple outlets accused Kehlani of being in a sex cult. While the singer has been candid about their previous experiences practicing the<strong> </strong>Regla de Ocha<strong> </strong>religion, or Santería, a religion that combines elements of Catholicism with the Yoruba religion of West Africa, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brittanica</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kehlani Daily (@kehlanidiary)</a></p></figure><p>Kehlani took to Instagram Stories to refute the claims they ever put involved their child in a sex cult or any other dangerous environment. Kehlani also said in the statement that the situation was a "legal, private, familial matter" between her and Javaughn.</p><p>"I have always taken great care to ensure that my child remains protected and safe at all times," they said in the post. "My child and my commitment to motherhood have always been my sole driving forces in this life and will always remain so. This is who I am and what I have always been focused on."</p><p>While Javaughn moved forward with the filing, he defended his ex with another post on his Instagram. He slammed outlets who accused Kehlani of being in a sex cult.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by @javaughnyw</a></p></figure><p>"I never said that I think Santería is a sex cult," Javaughn stated.

According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a>, they were granted the restraining order on Friday, Aug. 9. The filing stated Kehlani had been allegedly abused by Javaughn on multiple occasions, including during her pregnancy. However, the singer's final straw allegedly came in June 2024 after an incident where he allegedly "smashed through [Kehlani's locked bedroom doors [in] a fit of anger.”</p><p>They also accused Javaughn of being unkempt around their daughter, stating, "If he has our daughter in his care, she is returned filthy and reeking of marijuana.” Kehlani then said Javaughn is "emotionally unwell," which they believe is the catalyst for their "turbulent behavior."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by HOLLYWOOD UNLOCKED (@hollywoodunlocked)</a></p></figure><p>After the filing went public online, Javaughn addressed Kehlani's claims in another series of Instagram posts. He shared alleged texts between them and accused Kehlani of being the abuser in their relationship. Javaughn shared screenshots of their texts from July 2024, where he refused to have "direct communication" with them regarding their daughter. He then wrote that he went "no contact" with Kehlani in July before he filed for custody.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@javaughnyoungwhite</a></figure><p>Javaughn further alleged that, in one incident between them, Kehlani "busted through her own door and is framing her abuse as mine." He then continued sharing more screenshots of their conversations, including them praising their ex for being an "incredible father" and claiming he wanted them to leave him alone on multiple occasions. Kehlani responded on Instagram and denied telling the press about her restraining order against Javaughn.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoLKpuMCnoGaikauutrPHp2Syp6WjtG7Dx6KrnmWimrmiwMiopaygmaV6tbXMnqOippU%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkehlani-javaughn-young-white-relationship-timeline.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fkehlani-javaughn-young-white-relationship-timeline.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fkehlani-javaughn-young-white-relationship-timeline.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fkehlani-javaughn-young-white-relationship-timeline.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkehlani-javaughn-young-white-relationship-timeline.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkehlani-javaughn-young-white-relationship-timeline.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./273405-kra-pin-application-requirements-locals-foreigners-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./273405-kra-pin-application-requirements-locals-foreigners-html.html>KRA PIN application requirements for locals and foreigners</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./brie-larson-html.html>Brie Larson - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./brie-larson-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
