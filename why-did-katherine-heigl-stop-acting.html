Or maybe they think of the rom-com run she had in the late 2000s in Knocked Up, 27 Dresses, The Ugly Truth, and more. Either way, it definitely feels like Katherine has been away from major TV and big screen projects. So why did Katherine stop acting?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did Katherine Heigl stop acting?</h2><p>By the time Katherine became a household name because of her portrayal of Izzie Stevens, she had already been acting in movies for more than a decade in films like: Bride of Chucky, Under Siege 2: Dark Territory, and 100 Girls. Many might have also recognized Katherine from her role as Isabel Evans in Roswell on The WB.</p><p>In 2007, Katherine won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for her portrayal of Izzie in Grey's Anatomy. That same year, she also starred alongside Seth Rogen in the hit comedy movie Knocked Up.</p><p>However, a comment she made about the latter during an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanity Fair</a> caused a bit of drama. “It was a little sexist,” she told the publication in 2018. “It paints the women as shrews, as humorless and uptight, and it paints the men as lovable, goofy, fun-loving guys. It exaggerated the characters, and I had a hard time with it, on some days."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: getty</span></figure><p>Seth later told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, "We were funny together. I was having a really good time, and then when I heard afterward that she didn’t like it, that she seemed to not like the process, and she did not like the end product either, I think when that happens — also your trust feels somewhat betrayed."</p><p>On top of these comments, Katherine took her name out of the running for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series (as Izzie in Grey's Anatomy) for the 2008 Emmy Awards. "I did not feel that I was given the material this season to warrant an Emmy nomination," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she said in a statement</a>. "I did not want to potentially take away an opportunity from an actress who was given such materials."</p><p>This decision was widely criticized at the time, and unfortunately, it only helped to fuel reports that Katherine was "difficult" to work with as an actress.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: ABC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Katherine Heigl left 'Grey's Anatomy' in 2010.</h2><p>Katherine continued to portray Izzie for another season and a half on Grey's Anatomy, however she ended up getting let out of her contract early — in 2010 — in order to spend more time with her family.</p><p>The actress and her husband, Josh Kelly, now have three children together: daughters Naleigh and Adelaide, and a son, Joshua. Katherine and Josh confirmed the adoption of Naleigh from South Korea in September 2009, the adoption of Adelaide in April 2012, and the birth of Joshua in January 2017. So it makes sense that she'd want to lighten her acting load for a bit in order to focus time on her family.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Katherine Heigl is starring in the Netflix series 'Firefly Lane' in 2020.</h2><p>If you take a look at Katherine's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb profile</a>, it's not like she was completely out of the acting scene for a decade or anything — far from it, actually. Since her departure from Grey's Anatomy in 2010, she has worked as a voice actor in The Nut Job and The Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature. Katherine has also acted in the following movies and TV series: State of Affairs, Jenny's Wedding, Unforgettable, Doubt, Suits, and most recently, the Netflix series Firefly Lane.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Brought my girls to work last week. I don’t do it often cause I assume they’ll get bored and I’ll be distracted and chaos will ensue. But they loved it. They ran around the stages laughing and giggling and hushing up right quick when “rolling!” was shouted out. They pillaged the craft service table leaving nothing but a couple of stale potato chips and a hot dog bun in their wake. They studied the days sides and learned the names of all the crew members they could. They helped with my touch ups and my lines. They played hide and seek around the trailers on the lot and I found them hiding in the loft area above the drivers seat in my trailer like little mice nesting. They brought smiles to everyone’s faces and my heart swelled with a potent pride that they are mine and I am theirs. It kinda worked out perfectly despite my hesitation and now I’m amped to bring them all the time! What a blessing that I can. ❤️ Thank you once again @photos_by_roger for the beautiful pics!</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Katherine Heigl</a> (@katherineheigl) on Aug 5, 2019 at 7:49am PDT</p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>There you have it! Technically, Katherine Heigl never really stopped acting — she merely slowed down a bit for a few years to focus on family. But between the success of Suits and her new Netflix series, it seems like the actress could be well on her way to a major comeback. Fingers crossed!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2ajkam1pr7Ip5xmoJWetK150q2mqWWRmMGqusY%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-did-katherine-heigl-stop-acting.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhy-did-katherine-heigl-stop-acting.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhy-did-katherine-heigl-stop-acting.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhy-did-katherine-heigl-stop-acting.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-did-katherine-heigl-stop-acting.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-did-katherine-heigl-stop-acting.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./single-and-ready-to-jingle-filming-locations.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./single-and-ready-to-jingle-filming-locations.html>'Single and Ready to Jingle' Was Filmed in a Winter Wonderland</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-is-megyn-kelly-doing-these-days.html>What Is Megyn Kelly Doing These Days?
