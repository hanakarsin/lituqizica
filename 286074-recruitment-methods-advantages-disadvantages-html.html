Choosing the wrong method will lead to wasted effort and missed opportunity cost.

The article will discuss some of the recruitment methods that are used nowadays and look at the advantages and disadvantages of recruitment methods.</p><h2>1. Internal job postings</h2><p class=align-left>An <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">internal job posting</a> is a method of recruitment whereby a hiring manager posts an open job position for existing employees only. The applicants must be employees who have worked for the company within a specified period. That means external candidates cannot apply for the position. Recruiters choose this method because:</p><ul><li>They are looking for an individual who is familiar with the company’s policies, and procedures</li><li>They already have somebody in mind</li><li>They want to save time on the recruitment process</li><li>They want to promote current employees</li></ul><p class=align-left>When an employer ensures that all employees are aware of open positions and have equal opportunity to apply, it demonstrates fairness, openness, and transparency in the recruiting process.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/c8b8ff7e90b97f16.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>7 Brighter Monday alternatives for latest job vacancies in Kenya</span></p></a><h3>Advantages of internal job postings</h3><ul><li>It enhances employee morale</li><li>It demonstrates an opportunity for employees to advance within the organization and in their careers</li><li>Allows employers to fill positions fast</li><li>Reduces cost per hire</li><li>Improves the quality of hiring metrics</li><li>Helps to improve employee loyalty</li></ul><h3>Disadvantages of internal job postings</h3><ul><li>An employee risks losing a better paying job outside of the organization</li><li>Increases competition – the hired employee can face differences in opinion or ways of thinking from other employees</li><li>A company risks sticking with an employee who may not bring in new ideas</li><li>It can lead to a biased selection process if a company already has a candidate in mind</li><li>Other employees are likely to have a change of behavior towards the promoted employee</li></ul><p class=align-left>Hiring managers should not show favoritism or act arbitrarily in filling vacancies without paying attention to other qualified staff.</p><h2>2. Social media postings</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/1b0e1fa58879f719.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to win government tenders in Kenya</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/43a7eeb95e04ec9c.jpeg><p class=align-left>With more people using social networking sites to engage, hiring managers are scouring these networks to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">find new talent</a>. Companies are using social media nowadays because they can get more information about a candidate than what they can get from a traditional resume.</p><p class=align-left>Recruiters can know a potential employee’s personality, work ethics, and interests from their tweets, comments, and statutes. This information gives hiring managers the opportunity to look for discriminatory and inappropriate activity. It also tells them whether the candidate will be a good fit for the company.</p><h3>Advantages of social media postings</h3><p class=align-left>As one of the many methods of recruitment, the advantages of recruiting through social media include:</p><ul><li>Helps recruiters to reach a wider audience – recruiters can attract people from different backgrounds, and target passive talent.</li><li>It is direct, inexpensive, and modern – it is easy to use the social media and companies can target candidates with specific skills. Also, the cost of posting jobs on social media is lower compared to print advertising.</li><li>Recruiters can get background information about a candidate – it is easy to acquire information related to a potential candidate’s education, place of residence, and past employment.</li><li>It offers an easy way of screening candidates based on their social media activity</li><li>Accessibility – both the hiring manager and the potential candidate can access the social media from any location</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/8aef8f704a06aea7.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>KPA internship 2019: Minimum qualifications and the deadline for applying for the top fields</span></p></a><h3>Disadvantages of social media postings</h3><ul><li>Privacy concerns – although the internet is a public domain, a potential candidate may feel uncomfortable when an employee checks their accounts. People consider these accounts personal.</li><li>Inaccurate or missing information – not everyone uses social media from time to time. In addition, incorrect information on social media can make it difficult for recruiters to measure the accuracy of gauging personality.</li><li>It is time-consuming – since social media recruitment can attract many people, recruiters will have to spend more effort and time to review thousands of applications.</li><li>Unspecified talents and skills – people use social media for entertainment and personal reasons. Thus, it can be difficult to gauge their professional interests. You can easily misjudge a qualified employee based on the kinds of status he or she posts.</li></ul><p class=align-left>Social media offers an incredibly powerful tool for recruiters to conduct initial background checks before hiring new employees. But at the same time, it can give information that can negatively influence a recruiter’s judgment. As such, it is not a recruitment method that can stand on its own unless when it is supported by other recruitment processes.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/18ea90441d70670b.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Everything you need to know about quantity survey course in Kenya</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Good questions to ask in an interview</p><h2>3. Recruitment agencies</h2><p class=align-left>Recruitment agencies are firms that help companies to find potential candidates to fill open positions. Most of them specialize in specific areas or industries to ensure they get the best candidates for the job.</p><p class=align-left>Hiring at times can be challenging for companies especially when they want to fill positions in a field that is experiencing a shortage of talent. This shortage is often a leading reason why organizations in the logistics and supply chain disciplines, for example, use recruitment agencies to find new hires. In Kenya, there are many recruitment agencies available. Below are some of the benefits of using these agencies.</p><h3>Advantages of recruitment agencies</h3><ul><li>Time saving – the process of filling a vacancy is often quicker through a recruitment agency. An organization eliminates the process of advertising the positions, weeding out unqualified candidates, and doing references and background checks for qualified individuals.</li><li>They have industry knowledge and the market – they know where to get talented individuals and how to reach them. They also offer insights into current events, career expectations, salary rates, and hiring complexities in the industry.</li><li>They attract hard-to-reach candidates who do not respond to job advertisements.</li><li>They help with branding - recruitment agencies often give candidates real insights into a company. For example, they can tell them the benefits of the company, available career openings, and a feel for the company’s culture.</li><li>They give hiring managers a supporting and interactive hiring experience, negotiating skills, expert interviewing, strategic advice on recruitment, succession plans, and mentoring.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhsqa0i3qrstbs.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Details on causes of conflict in an organization setting</span></p></a><h3>Disadvantages of recruitment agencies</h3><ul><li>It is expensive – some recruiters can ask <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">up to 30%</a> of the new employee’s salary. Furthermore, a retainer firm can be expensive in the long run if they fail to bring in qualifying candidates.</li><li>Mixed priorities – some firms work on commissions, meaning that their priorities and focus may be different to an employer’s.</li><li>It is easy for these agencies to place candidates where they do not belong or in the same positions as their previous ones.</li><li>Competition – large companies pay more to get the best talent. That means small companies will have to compete for the rejected candidates.</li></ul><p class=align-left>Recruitment agencies help companies to save time during the hiring process. Although they are expensive, they can ensure companies get the right candidates for open positions.</p><h2>4. Employee referral programs</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/c8b8ff7e90b97f16.jpeg><p class=align-left>Employee referral programs are internal methods of recruitment that take advantage of existing employee networks. Companies consider their current employees as their best ambassadors. Thus, they bring them together to improve the hiring process.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0fgjhs7k9p8cv3f3t.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Volunteer jobs in Kenya - Best opportunities</span></p></a><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Employee referral programs</a> encourage the existing employees to choose and recruit the most qualifying candidates from their professional and social networks. By allowing them to recruit, it helps a company to save money and increase productivity.</p><h3>Advantages of employee referral programs</h3><ul><li>It is easier to hire referred candidates than traditional candidates. Hiring managers can avoid posting or advertising for positions. They will just receive resumes and review them.</li><li>Saves money – a company does not incur the cost of hiring new employees.</li><li>Helps to improve employee retention – referred employees tend to work at organizations for longer due to the underlying commitment to their friends.</li><li>It demonstrates that a company values its employees’ insight</li><li>Helps to improve employee morale.</li><li>Improves the quality of hiring new employees since employees will only bring in individuals who carry the qualities that go in line with the organization.</li><li>It is a suitable recruitment method in an industry experiencing a shortage of talent to fill specialized positions.</li></ul><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/499b05d83af168a0.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Internship in Kenya banks: opportunities, requirements, application 2021</span></p></a><h3>Disadvantages of employees referral programs</h3><ul><li>Hiring managers may not deem the referred candidates fit for the positions.</li><li>It can dent employee morale if hiring managers fail to select the referred candidates.</li><li>A company risks introducing a culture of ‘like-mindedness’. In the long run, there could be a limit on the number of different ideas, viewpoints, and opinions managers receive.</li><li>When a company loses one employee, they may lose even more. In other words, if a referred employee is fired, the employee that referred them may quit as a protest to the firing.</li></ul><p class=align-left>Employee referral programs can be effective if managed carefully and sensitively. While these programs can be effective, companies should bolster them with other strategies to ensure they only hire a diverse group of individuals.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Types of interviews in Kenya</p><h2>5. Online job boards</h2><p class=align-left>Online job boards are websites that deal with careers and employment. Also known as job banks, they allow employers to advertise job requirements for vacant positions in their organizations. Potential candidates can also use these sites to find suitable employment opportunities. If you are an employer in Kenya, there are a couple of online job boards where you can post your job.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/7748da0db205a0b2.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Paid internships in Kenya: A detailed guide to various internship opportunities</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Some online job boards are advanced that they help to enhance the recruitment and selection methods of qualifying candidates. For example, recruiting managers can use the sites to receive and manage applications and distribute jobs to different aggregators, networks, and other boards.</p><h3>Advantages of online job boards</h3><ul><li>Helps recruiters reach more people – online job boards attract hundreds to thousands of potential candidates who are all looking for jobs.</li><li>Convenient – as long as a hiring manager has access to the internet, it will be easy for them to post a job online and expect thousands to view it. Managers can, therefore, search for new hires anytime, anywhere. On the other hand, potential employees can apply for positions anytime, anywhere.</li><li>Hiring managers have many choices for posting jobs – specialist and generalist boards are available online to ensure companies get the right candidates based on the job position.</li><li>It is easier for potential candidates to make multiple job applications without uploading the same information repeatedly.</li><li>Helps companies improve their brand image – companies can create online profiles to attract new talent, and show them what it is like to work for them.</li><li>It is cheaper than print media</li><li>Offers unlimited space to give more information about the job</li></ul><h3>Disadvantages of online job boards</h3><ul><li>Time-consuming - Hiring managers can receive thousands of applications even after filling vacant positions. That means they will have to sift through dozens of applications in the search for the right candidate.</li><li>There is a high chance unqualified applicants will apply for the advertised job position.</li><li>Offers no guarantees that a hiring manager will find the ideal candidate for the job.</li><li>Since people are applying online, it is possible that hiring managers will find qualified candidates who are not within a favored location.</li><li>It is possible to miss out on passive candidates.</li></ul><p class=align-left>Before posting on online job boards, hiring managers should first do their research to determine which board specializes in what they are looking for in candidates. They should also understand that job boards alone cannot be effective unless supported by other employee recruitment methods.</p><p class=align-left>Vacant positions in an organization occur when a company is growing or diversifying. They also occur as a result of retirement, terminations, or resignations. Regardless, it will be up to the company’s hiring managers to fill the available positions, meaning that they will have to choose the most effective recruitment methods to find new qualified employees. Choosing the right recruitment method is important because it can determine whether a company will hire qualified candidates or not.</p><p></p><strong class=article-ytsubscribe__title>Subscribe to watch new videos</strong><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2Bl29ncGxdp7KkvtSiq6adnql6rrHToaadq12Wsbetza2YoJ2jYrGqv8CdrZqmpJa0pr%2BNoaumpA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f286074-recruitment-methods-advantages-disadvantages-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f286074-recruitment-methods-advantages-disadvantages-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f286074-recruitment-methods-advantages-disadvantages-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f286074-recruitment-methods-advantages-disadvantages-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f286074-recruitment-methods-advantages-disadvantages-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f286074-recruitment-methods-advantages-disadvantages-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./rurru-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./rurru-html.html>Rurru - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./249248-orodha-ya-viongozi-mashuhuri-akiwemo-barack-obama-watakaohudhuria-sherehe-za-html.html>Orodha ya viongozi mashuhuri akiwemo Barack Obama watakaohudhuria sherehe za kuapishwa kwa rais mtar</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./249248-orodha-ya-viongozi-mashuhuri-akiwemo-barack-obama-watakaohudhuria-sherehe-za-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
