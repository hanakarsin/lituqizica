There is also a royal patriarch, certain that no one can guess the texture of an oversized flea hide, who bets his daughter’s hand in marriage only to lose her to an ogre.

Beauty and the Beast</i></h3><p class=align-left>This is a 2014 movie. This film follows an 18th-century fantasy from Christophe Gans that does not involve singing teacups or candelabra-on-feather-duster. Instead, Gans offers a cross-species romance a macabre shine and manages to maintain the story’s French setting and language.</p><p class=align-left>According to Disney’s version, Belle acted by Léa Seydoux swaps in for her elderly father when the Beast played by Vincent Cassel demands to take a prisoner. In this version, Gans lets both the romance and magic swirl through darkness resulting in something warm and tender.</p><p class=align-left>The secret is in taming the Beast’s tender growl, which he does through a number of dream sequences, and his conflicted prince succumbs to the power of love. One thing everyone loves more than anything, though, is his French accent.</p><h3><i>3. Pete's Dragon</i></h3><p class=align-left>This is a 2016 film that is an actual Disney movie. All moviegoers who grew up on the 1977 2D/live-action musical version of <i>Pete’s Dragon</i> may have shrugged off this great remake as nothing close to the original.

The story is a mix of small-town chill with the warmth of special-effects creation.</p><p class=align-left>The entire movie was shot on location, which made everything feel so real that you never question a fluffy green giant that protects his best friend from social services and money-grubbing hunters.</p><h3><i>2. Legend of the Naga Pearls</i></h3><p class=align-left>The 2017 film is set in the world of Novoland, the Chinese equivalent of Middle-earth, this audacious action-fantasy is a sugary cocktail mixed from Pirates of the Caribbean, Star Wars, Hellboy and wuxia classics.

Everything is made to look so real that you can hardly tell the amount of makeup that went into creating the perfect characters.</p><h3><i>1. Bridge to Terabithia</i></h3><p class=align-left>This powerful movie is from 2007. Not all fantasy stories take place in faraway lands, and some actually come to life right in our backyards. This is one of such films.
