Binh tested positive for COVID-19 shortly before their wedding day and their ceremony was postponed, which delayed their nuptials and put them behind the other couples in terms of time spent together.</p><p>And in an exclusive clip ahead of the Sept. 14 episode of MAFS, they butt heads over a loss of trust, proving that they really can't catch a break. But what happened between Morgan and Binh to make the MAFS couple so upset with each other that they may not give their marriage a fighting chance?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Lifetime</span><p>Morgan and Binh from 'Married at First Sight'</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What happened between Morgan and Binh on 'Married at First Sight'?</h2><p>Prior to the Sept. 14 episode of MAFS, Morgan and Binh already had issues. They fought on their honeymoon when Binh learned that Morgan wasn't totally truthful about her occupation. She explained that she was still in nursing school while working as a nurse to obtain a higher degree. Binh took this to mean she had lied about her profession and where she is in life when she initially spoke to the experts.</p><p>It created a rift that only seems to have grown. Because in the Sept. 14 episode, things are still rough between them. And now, in the clip, Morgan calls out Binh for talking about their problems with the other men in the experiment.</p><p>"You're telling me you don't wanna do lies, you're telling me that lies are awful and horrible, but you've been lying to my face, essentially daily." Morgan says in the clip.</p><p>She says that Binh has confided in fellow MAFS cast member Justin about their marriage behind her back numerous times.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Morgan and Binh's wedding was postponed.</h2><p>Maybe things were doomed from the start for Morgan and Binh. Unlike the other couples this season, they had to wait to get married because Binh contracted COVID-19. At the time, he promised to make it up to his new wife with another future honeymoon anywhere she wanted, but the time lost seems to have made a difference in how they've progressed as a couple.</p><p>To be fair, Morgan and Binh aren't the only cast members in Season 15 who could use some of Pastor Cal's magic couples therapy. But you can't help but wonder if they're in such a rough spot because they got a late start.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Lifetime</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Are Morgan and Binh together after 'MAFS'?</h2><p>We don't know for sure who stays together and who gets divorced in Season 15 of MAFS. But there are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">rumors</a> that Morgan and Binh don't even make it to Decision Day. For now, that's not confirmed. But with the way things are going, are you even surprised?</p><p>Hopefully, even if Morgan and Binh can't work through their issues on MAFS, they can take something away from the experience.</p><p>Watch Married at First Sight on Wednesdays at 8 p.m. EST on Lifetime.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnBnquwnZWjeq670aCYp2WRo7Fursinn2alkae%2FqrHDZpitZZaev7TAjKygoKCk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-between-morgan-and-binh-married-at-first-sight.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwhat-happened-between-morgan-and-binh-married-at-first-sight.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-morgan-and-binh-married-at-first-sight.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwhat-happened-between-morgan-and-binh-married-at-first-sight.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-morgan-and-binh-married-at-first-sight.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-morgan-and-binh-married-at-first-sight.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./428575-dandora-mother-arrested-suspicion-her-sons-expensive-was-stolen-finally-released-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./428575-dandora-mother-arrested-suspicion-her-sons-expensive-was-stolen-finally-released-html.html>Dandora Mother Spends 3 Days in Police Cell over Son's Bike: &amp;quot;Neighbours Said We Stole It&amp;quot;</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./weird-american-habits.html>These Are the Weirdest Things Americans Do, According to People in Other Countries</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./weird-american-habits.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
