He was the youngest of his siblings. His father, Robert Downey Sr. is an actor and filmmaker. He is of half Lithuanian Jewish, one-quarter Irish, and another quarter Hungarian Jewish descent. Jon’s mother, on the other hand, was of Scottish, Swiss, and German ancestry. She was called Elsie Ann. Elsie Ann was also in the film industry as her husband, and she was an actress who made appearances in the Downey Sr.’s films.</p><p class=align-left>Initially, Robert went by the name Elias which was the family name. However, Downer Sr. made changes to the title when he went to enlist in the army. John and his sister Allyson were brought up in Greenwich Village. In his childhood, John acknowledges that drugs were easily accessible in their home. His father was a drug addict, and he allowed John to smoke marijuana at the mere age of six. Since his father was also smoking pot, John saw this as a bonding opportunity for the two.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/b96431f95a01ce96.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Charles Pol's bio and net worth: what does he do for a living?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Robert eventually started abusing alcohol and was the verge of becoming a drug addict just like his father. Due to this particular reason, his father much regrets introducing him to smoking marijuana. As a teenager, John attended the Stagedoor Manor Performing Arts Training Center which is in upstate New York City. Later in 1978, his parents got divorced, and he, therefore, had to move to California to stay with his father. However, in 1982, John dropped out of Santa Monica High School and moved back to New York City to go after an acting career, full-time.</p><h2>Robert Downey Jr. net worth</h2><p class=align-left>Most people believe that this respected American actor is among the top-earning actors in the world.
