Finally, you find them, you date for a time, it's everything you ever wanted, and then it happens â€” the first sleepover. Soon after, BAM! you get an elbow to the face at 4 a.m. by your sleepy lover and now you're beginning to understand <a href=#>Dateline</a> a little more than before.</p><p>Although those weren't the exact chain of events that led to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikToker @kat.studios</a> choosing to sleep separately from her boyfriend, she is "sick and tired" of people assuming the worst about her relationship simply for enjoying her own time away from her boyfriend whenever she wants to.</p><p>She took to TikTok to share some of her reasons for the separation.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Sony Pictures Entertainment</span><p>'King of Queens' Season 5, Episode 25 titled "Bed Spread."</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">She doesn't share the same bedroom with her boyfriend. Now she is explaining why they sleep separately on TikTok.</h2><p>The relationship has been going strong for six years with about three to four of those years spent living with her boyfriend. She began the TikTok by saying, "It is amazing how people will jump to conclusions and just make the worst assumptions about our relationship when they find out."</p><p>First things first, she prefaces her reasoning by saying that they usually end up sleeping in the same room, but sometimes life gets in the way. For example, if one of them has to wake up early for work they wouldn't want to disturb each other, so they'd opt to sleep in their own bedroom that evening.</p><p>Another example given was if one of them was sick then the other bedroom would come in handy to protect further spread.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@kat.studios href=#>@kat.studios</a><p>People ask me all the time when we will finally start sharing a room...

However, it seems they found a solution that works perfectly for them. She continued: "It's just really nice having that sense of freedom and independence in a committed relationship where you have to compromise on everything else."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I share a bedroom (bed) with my husband but canâ€™t see why itâ€™s a big deal choosing not to. Itâ€™s the same as some couples choose to pool all their finances, others prefer to keep them separate. No big deal either way imo. Everyone is different. Not bashing them for this.</p>â€” Jo (@JoeJoecoven) <a href=#>July 10, 2023</a></figure><p>The very last reason she shared was, "Sometimes couples fight and it's really nice to have a private, personal space where you can go take a beat, get your thoughts in order, take some for yourself, etc." Amen, girl! Shut that door and pretend he doesn't exist for a little while. That's what we love to call self-care.</p><p>She signs off with a little nugget of wisdom for the people saying, "If you ever meet a couple that maybe doesn't share the same bedroom or does something else that seems odd to you try not to jump to conclusions, try not to make assumptions, try not to be an ass!"</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">She later found support in the comments</h2><p>Plenty of people did not hesitate to sound off in the comments sharing their own relationship realness in regard to sharing a space with a significant other.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok</span></figure><p>Another user amongst the many others with the same sentiment shared, "My wife & I have our own rooms. I am very neat & she isn't. we both get to have our own space & office since we work from home. very happy! [together] 22 yrs."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">She responded to the round of support in the comments with another TikTok</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@kat.studios href=#>@kat.studios</a><p>Replying to @rachelthescrub Thank you! We definently need to normalize seperate blankets too! Also, thank you to @everyone for all the support!

"It's been so cool knowing that I'm not the only one," she concluded her thanks.</p><p>Quite frankly, I completely agree with her. A safe personal space in a long-term romantic relationship is priceless and necessary. I say let's leave the co-sleeping to the grandparents in Willy Wonka.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmLy2vMueZKGZo2LAprzAq5itnV2XsqW%2BzqikrA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcouple-has-separate-bedrooms.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcouple-has-separate-bedrooms.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcouple-has-separate-bedrooms.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcouple-has-separate-bedrooms.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcouple-has-separate-bedrooms.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcouple-has-separate-bedrooms.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./laura-harrier-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./laura-harrier-html.html>Laura Harrier - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./406892-kris-jenner-says-she-never-paid-bills-married-late-ex-robert-kardashian-html.html>Kris Jenner Says She Never Paid Bills when Married to Late Ex Robert Kardashian</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./406892-kris-jenner-says-she-never-paid-bills-married-late-ex-robert-kardashian-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
