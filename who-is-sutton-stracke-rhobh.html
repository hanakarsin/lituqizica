But there seems to be a new woman taking on the 90210 area code and her name is Sutton Stracke.&nbsp;</p><p>When <a href=#>Lisa Vanderpump</a> left <a href=#>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</a> by making a statement to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Radar Online</a>, her castmates, Andy Cohen, and fans were shocked.&nbsp;</p><p>She had been on the show since the very first episode, and what is RHOBH without LVP? But, it seems like Lisa Vanderpump's sworn enemy, Lisa Rinna, might be having the last laugh on the show, as her bestie Sutton is joining the cast. Who is <a href=#>Sutton Stracke</a>? Read on for a breakdown of her family life and career.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Sutton Stracke on RHOBH? She leads a luxurious life.</h2><p>Though we'll never have another swan-filled pink paradise quite like LVP's Villa Rosa, there is no shortage of exorbitant wealth on RHOBH.&nbsp;</p><p>Sutton Stracke can certainly keep up with Kyle Richards, Lisa Rinna, and Erika Girardi's extravagant lifestyles. The blonde originally hails from the south, which is where she learned the grace of a debutante. She's taken her etiquette training and turned it into a career.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Summer fun! ðŸ’—ðŸ’—ðŸ’—</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>suttonstracke</a> (@suttonstracke) on Jul 7, 2019 at 7:20am PDT</p></figure><p>Sutton was ranked on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Salonniere</a>'s Top 100 party planners list back in 2017. The list was created by asking influencers and people in-the-know about who had the best parties across the country. She made the list for the Los Angeles section, and Barack and Michelle Obama, as well as Mariska Hargitay, were among some of the others featured.</p><p>Sutton can also add being a mom of three to her list of accomplishments. She has three kids, sons James and Philip, and a daughter named Porter. She's married to Christian Stracke, but he doesn't make it onto her Instagram page often, though her kids do.&nbsp;</p><p>The two are also active supporters of art, and have made sizable donations to the ballet and galleries. She's also set to open a clothing store called SUTTON in the coming months and, hopefully, it goes better than Kyle's storefront.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">She's best friends with some famous faces.&nbsp;</h2><p>Sutton was first put in contact with producers from RHOBH through her friendship with Lisa Rinna. Most Housewives who join any branch of the franchise are usually friends with another cast member so there's some link to the group. The rest of the RHOBH cast was allegedly nervous about who might join the show, as they needed a strong person to fill LVP's absence, and cause controversy.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Sutton and Lisa Rinna attended Elton John's Academy Awards viewing party together in February. She's also posted pictures with Dita Von Teese and bestie Jennifer Tilly (who starred in the Child's Play franchise). Much of Sutton's Instagram feed consists of pictures of her and friends at various charity events, which supports her ranking as a top party planner and influential attendee.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Tori Spelling wanted in on the show, but then Sutton was offered a role.</h2><p>Unsurprisingly, there were other women who wanted the coveted spot on RHOBH. One of them has already starred in a Beverly Hills-centric role: Tori Spelling.&nbsp;</p><p>The Beverly Hills 90210 star has a packed reality TV resume, but she had set her sights on RHOBH. While appearing on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Jenny McCarthy Show</a> with co-star Jennie Garth, Tori said that she felt she could add something new to the franchise.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Tori said that because she was born and raised in Beverly Hills, she'd have a perspective and background that nobody on the show has ever had before. She also claimed that, as the mother of five, she would have no shortage of drama going on.&nbsp;</p><p>Her friendship with cast member Denise Richards would also serve as a way for her to get acquainted with the cast, but nobody from the show ever reached out to her. She also claimed that Jennie Garth had previously been asked to be on RHOBH but she said no.</p><p>In an awkward TV moment, Tori confronted Andy Cohen about how her public desire to join RHOBH went unnoticed when she appeared on Watch What Happens Live.&nbsp;</p><p>When a viewer called in and asked if Tori had considered doing the show, she said, "I don't know, Andy's never asked me." She went on to say that she was a huge fan of the show and that she was offended that the offer was never extended. Watch the video below to see the uncomfortable interaction.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Sutton is set to make her debut as a member of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills in 2020. Rumor has it that she's getting along well with Kyle Richards already, but there will surely be some drama to break down.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZKytpKm8r3nSramam5uaerO0zpuf</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-sutton-stracke-rhobh.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-is-sutton-stracke-rhobh.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-sutton-stracke-rhobh.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-is-sutton-stracke-rhobh.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-sutton-stracke-rhobh.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-sutton-stracke-rhobh.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./casey-neistat-scratches-car-leaves-note.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./casey-neistat-scratches-car-leaves-note.html>YouTuber Leaves Note With Info on Car He Scratched, Was Floored by Follow-Up Text</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./many-reportedly-killed-houses-destroyed-as-okada-riders-clash-with-traders.html>Many Reportedly Killed, Houses Destroyed As Okada Riders Clash With Traders</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./many-reportedly-killed-houses-destroyed-as-okada-riders-clash-with-traders.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
