However, the man in the car didn't sound like he wanted to get out of the drive-thru and would much rather wait in front of the window, as he says there was no one behind him.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @n0tworriedbittch</span></figure><p>The employees tried calmly explaining to the guest that they were working on fulfilling his order, but that answer didn't seem to sit right with the drive-thru customer: "Yes sir it does take a few minutes before we make them," one of the employees, a woman wearing glasses, tells the man.</p><p>"No I understand that but there's no one behind us if there was someone behind us we would pull up, there's no one behind us and I already spoke to your DM and he already said we don't have to pull up," the customer can be heard saying off camera.</p><p>At this point in their discussion, another employee approaches the window to speak to the man and begins to talk to him about mobile orders, however, the customer seems intent on staying in the drive-thru lane: "You can call your district manager he already knows that we don't have to pull up it's your policy."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @n0tworriedbittch</span></figure><p>"Well when you place a mobile order, we have to have time to make it."</p><p>"Right, and y'all can go ahead and make it there's no one behind us."</p><p>The employee looks out at the drive-thru lane and explains to the man, "Okay so what we do because we have this timer-"</p><p>The man then begins to cut the employee off and begins to talk further stating that he won't move, and the worker instructs him to pull up multiple times before the man counters and tells her to call the restaurant's district manager.</p><p>She tells him that she won't and he can call the manager and that he should pull up to the front or she's going to call the police for not clearing the drive-thru.</p><p>"Call the police on what?" the man says. The woman doubles down and says, "I will because you won't move out my drive-thru."</p><p>"You're gonna lose your job I hope you know that."</p><p>"Okay well go ahead."</p><p>"You really wanna lose your job?"</p><p>"Hey, do what you gotta do. You think you can control me having a job then you go ahead." the woman tells the man and another employee can be heard laughing inside the restaurant.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @n0tworriedbittch</span></figure><p>Viewers who saw the clip didn't seem too impressed with the way the drive-thru customer conducted themselves. One person wrote: "He didn't want food he wanted an argument."</p><p>While another remarked, "I love her so much for saying that. I love that customers think they have that much influence in situations like that"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @n0tworriedbittch</span></figure><p>And then there was one commenter who speculated as to why some people decide to try and make fast food workers' lives miserable: "I think ppl just do this to feel something"</p><p>While someone else noticed a dynamic shift in the conversation once the customer realized he couldn't scare the employee into getting his way by threatening her job: "She took all his â€˜powerâ€™ away with that last sentence. YES MAAM."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmMK0wM6mnKtllJq6orrDrGSipZ2asaqt055krJ2iq7aksYydqaKulWLBqb7U</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcustomer-demands-immediate-service-drive-thru.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fcustomer-demands-immediate-service-drive-thru.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fcustomer-demands-immediate-service-drive-thru.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fcustomer-demands-immediate-service-drive-thru.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcustomer-demands-immediate-service-drive-thru.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcustomer-demands-immediate-service-drive-thru.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./1228371-interesting-facts-sharo-fulani-festival-boys-endure-flogging-a-rite-passage-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./1228371-interesting-facts-sharo-fulani-festival-boys-endure-flogging-a-rite-passage-html.html>Interesting facts about Sharo, the Fulani festival where boys endure flogging as a rite of passage</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./carlos-cadorniga.html>Callie (Carlos) Cadorniga - Distractify</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./carlos-cadorniga.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
