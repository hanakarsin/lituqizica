It's incredibly unethical and typically has serious psychological and emotional effects on the kids involved. Although most parents know it's wrong, many still do it, including these toxic exes in the popular "Am I the A------" (<a href=#>AITA</a>) subreddit.</p><p>The original poster, who goes by the handle <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">u/Dependent-Stand-8707</a>, said he refuses to pay for anything related to his daughter's quinceañera because his ex-wife picked a venue without consulting him about it first.</p><p>Read on for the rest of the story. Plus, stick around to hear what the internet has to say.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">This dad refuses to pay for anything related to his daughter's Quinceañera.</h2><p>The OP <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">provided</a> a bit of back story, revealing that he and his ex-wife share four kids together. They divorced in 2015 due to her infidelity, and unsurprisingly, they ended their relationship on pretty bad terms.</p><p>Anyways, their youngest and only daughter recently told them she wanted to throw a party for her 15th birthday. The OP's ex-wife started looking into venues, and after she found one she liked, she told the OP to pay for it. He refused, noting that he never agreed to this because she looked at venues without telling him in the first place.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Reddit / u/Affectionate_Ask_769</a></figure><p>Plus, the OP and his new wife already planned to throw a party for his daughter (and it didn't include his ex-wife). He suggested that his ex-wife that throw another party for their daughter to celebrate with her side of the family, and it's safe to say she wasn't too happy.</p><p>"She got mad and berated me for being a horrible father and not providing for our child," the OP said, adding that his daughter was "mad at me for not paying for the venue, and she won't speak to me. ... The last thing she said was that she didn't want the stupid party me and my wife wanted to [throw for her]."</p><p>So, what's the verdict? Is the OP the AH? Keep scrolling to hear what fellow Redditors have to say!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">In the end, Reddit agreed that everyone sucks in this situation.</h2><p>The now-viral post received over 2,000 comments from Redditors who agreed that everyone sucks here. Now, in this instance, "everyone" doesn't include the OP's daughter — it only refers to the OP and his ex-wife.</p><p>"You and your ex are terrible at co-parenting, and you both suck at communication," one user <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>. "You knew your daughter was going to turn 15 at some point, and this should have been addressed much earlier. Leave your daughter out of this. She is a child, and you are the grown-up. Grow up and figure out how to fix all this."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Reddit / u/Comfortable-Focus123</a></figure><p>A second person <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a>, "You knew your daughter was gonna turn 15 eventually, and of course, your daughter is gonna want her big moment. [On the other hand], these events usually take at least a couple months to plan; the OP's ex had plenty of time to tell him the plan and get his budget."</p><p>"Your ex-wife did exactly what you did," someone else <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pointed out</a>. "You both tried to plan a party behind each other's backs without consulting one another. Although you didn't ask her for money, you clearly forgot to consult with your daughter, who didn't want the party you were planning for her when she found out."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Reddit / u/FortuneTellingBoobs</span></figure><p>Another person <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stated</a>, "A Quinceañera is a HUGE thing in many Hispanic cultures. This is the time that OP and his ex need to act like adults who love their daughter and cooperate to throw one heck of a party. Instead, both OP and his ex are using this occasion to bash each other. The loser isn't OP or the ex. The loser is the daughter."</p><p>What do you think? Should the OP just pay for the venue?
