The news comes more than a year after she was arrested for the crime. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a>, who spoke with her attorney, she was found unfit to stand trial after being evaluated by three different mental health professionals. Now, many want to know who Mollie played in Captain America.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Mollie worked as an actress and director before she was arrested.</h2><p>Prior to being arrested, Mollie was working in Hollywood as a writer and director. Her most high-profile acting role was undoubtedly in Captain America, but since then, she's gone on to write and direct on a number of short films, including The Creeps, About a Dog, and The King of Wishful Thinking. Now, though, she's best known for her the crime she's accused of committing.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who did Mollie play in 'Captain America'?</h2><p>Given the headlines about her, many are wondering exactly what role Mollie played in Captain America: The First Avenger. As it turns out, her part in the movie was relatively small. She played one of Howard Stark's assistants, and was credited as "Stark Girl" in the credits. Her only scene in the movie is during the Stark Expo in 1943, when she shares a stage with Dominic Cooper's Howard Stark, who is introducing his prototype of a flying car.</p><p>Howard and Mollie's character share a kiss, but her total screen time is around 15 seconds. As it turns out, Mollie also played a role behind the scenes on the project, serving as one of director Joe Johnston's assistants in the film. When the movie first came out in 2011, Mollie gave an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Comic Book Movie</a> where she expressed gratitude for her role on the project.</p><p>“Although my part is small in this film, I did get to work closely with Dominic Cooper for a few minutes and that was wonderful,” she said at the time. “Joe Johnston is an unbelievable director, and I’ve learned a lot about directing from him. Being a part of this production has been one of the best experiences of my life.”</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Mollie will be re-evaluated every 90 days to see if she can stand trial.</h2><p>Following the ruling that she was not currently fit to stand trial, Mollie will return to receive treatment in a mental hospital. Her mental state will be reviewed every 90 days to determine whether she is fit to stand trial. Doctors explained that Mollie was unable to help her attorney mount a defense for her, and that she didn't fully understand what was going on.</p><p>Mollie's attorney did clarify, though, that she understands she's been accused of killing her mother, and understands the role her attorneys, the prosecutors, and the judge play, but gets confused about how the process of a trial works. Mollie initially claimed self-defense in the case, but prosecutors say she was the aggressor, having stabbed her mother four times in the back.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecOim2aln6G5qrGMn6Ctspeav6K4w2anpZmpYravecKap62ZmaN6ornEq6CcmQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-did-mollie-fitzgerald-play-in-captain-america.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwho-did-mollie-fitzgerald-play-in-captain-america.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwho-did-mollie-fitzgerald-play-in-captain-america.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwho-did-mollie-fitzgerald-play-in-captain-america.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-did-mollie-fitzgerald-play-in-captain-america.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-did-mollie-fitzgerald-play-in-captain-america.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./why-did-twitch-ban-ryan-haywood.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./why-did-twitch-ban-ryan-haywood.html>Why Did Twitch Ban Ryan Haywood After His Return to the Site?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./rich-little-html.html>Rich Little - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./rich-little-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
