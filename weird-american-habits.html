If you grew up around immigrants or in an even slightly heterogenous community, you've probably picked up on some totally American norms people from other parts of the world look at with disgust.</p><p>When I was growing up, one of the small things I took for granted, being born and raised here, was the strangeness of meal-accompanying beverages my mother always sought to point out. She mentioned early on how turned off she was by her college roommate's desire for a Diet Coke with breakfast, and she was equally perplexed by the glass of milk the same woman enjoyed every evening with dinner.</p><p>So when people took to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a> to ask people from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">other countries</a> what they found mind-blogging about American practices, the results did not disappoint. Read on to have your mind blown about our strange cultural practices, and to rethink 14 everyday norms you definitely take for granted.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">1. They don't see the big deal with drinking in public.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock</span></figure><p>Between open container citations and public intoxication laws, it's definitely illegal — if not grossly frowned upon by your prudent friends who aren't trying to get dragged into your antics — to drink alcohol in public in America.&nbsp;</p><p>But to people in the rest of the world, this concept is incredibly strange. When answering the question of what American norms are viewed differently in Japan, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">AsakiYumemiru</a> didn't see the logic behind "drinking alcohol in public being a huge deal."</p><p>A Western redditor who frequently travels to Asia for work countered this observation by mentioning how "blown away" they were by the "level of midweek drunkenness among over-30 respectable business men and women" that goes on in Japan.&nbsp;</p><p>"You can drink beer like that in Germany!" added a European redditor. Having lived in Germany, I can vouch for the fact that even the public drinking there is carried out efficiently. "People leave their bottles beside trash cans so that people that scavenge them for recycling don't have to dig through the trash instead. 10/10 respect," writes <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zerole00</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">2. Prices are never what they say they are.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: istock</span></figure><p>It can be incredibly frustrating to pick out something you want that costs one thing, and then learning it actually costs more than that once the cashier has rung it up.&nbsp;</p><p>"Not including tax in the price tags" is something that annoys many foreigners who visit America. User <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">relayrider</a> added, "yeah, that and tips..."</p><p>As an American, I'd be more than happy to get rid of these hidden costs as well. Like, how is one even supposed to know how much things truly cost? One unhelpful <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PM_ME_A_PLANE_TICKET</a> responded, "sales tax is roughly 7% almost everywhere. Maybe 6.9% in county A, and 7.5% in county B. A $50 item would be $53 and change in both counties. You kind of do it in your head."</p><p>Wow, good thing calculators come standard on phones nowadays.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">3. We wear our shoes inside the house.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock</span></figure><p>We Americans are all, Why take off our shoes when we can trace everything we've stepped on throughout the day around our home?</p><p>As someone raised in an immigrant home, I was barely allowed inside the door without &nbsp;first taking my shoes off growing up, so this is a practice I truly don't condone. But a surprising amount of Americans see no problem with only taking their shoes off to sleep. "For [Americans who don't regularly experience downpours or heavy snow], shoes are kept in the bedroom and put on right after pants, and not removed until [it's] time to disrobe," explains <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">kaihatsusha</a>.</p><p>Foreign people, meanwhile, think wearing shoes inside the house is absolutely revolting. But that's not all — at least in Japan, they have different inside-the-house slippers for summer than they do for winter.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">4. We eat like crap.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock</span></figure><p>Fast food? Saturated fats? High-fructose corn syrup? It's pretty safe to say these are all American inventions, or at least things that wouldn't be as popular if it weren't for out unabashed consumption.</p><p>But people in other parts of the world eat way fresher and better. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">crusoe</a>, Americans can also feel way healthier by taking a tip or two out of their books: "I've switched to a more Japanese-style diet. More rice, vegetables, fish, chicken. I've lost twenty pounds and my guts have felt way better. Plus it's super easy to cook ... I find even their fried foods don't feel as heavy."</p><p>"In a country facing high obesity rates, the junk food is cheaper than the healthier stuff by quite a bit," writes another redditor about the strange nutritional practices of Americans. It's true that our fast food is insanely cheap while we basically have to choose between spending money on organic groceries or filling up our tanks to drive to work. "It's so bizarre to see those ads that are like MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF CHICKEN NUGGETS FOR A DOLLAR!!!" echoed another foreigner.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">5. Public bathrooms are too public.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: reddit</span></figure><p>If you ever wondered why there is a gap between the door and frame of a public bathroom stall, you are not alone.&nbsp;</p><p>"Having weirdly large gaps in your toilet doors. It’s just not necessary guys," one foreign redditor mused. Another agreed, sharing a photo of the future of American public restrooms. "This is in the Seattle Convention Center. When I was there just standing at the urinal you could see into the whole stall," @<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">McHaloKitty</a> added. OMG. That is horrifying.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">6. All of our drinks have sugar in them.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock</span></figure><p>You might say not all drinks in America have sugar, but I'd challenge you to come up with five non-water beverages. In other countries, and especially in Japan, there are far more options when you (and your waistline) aren't dying to imbibe pure saccharine.&nbsp;</p><p>User <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">AsakiYumemiru</a> said it's abhorrent for Asian people to see Westerners "putting sugar in green tea," and also called out our lack of sugar-free beverages.</p><p>Even Americans lamented how "all of our drinks have sugar in them, except for water." One even added that they'd "love to have sugar-free tasty drinks without artificial sugars in them too, the whole Stevia hype is so gross."&nbsp;</p><p>You hear that, Coca-Cola?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">7. Japanese people don't know what to do with apples.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: istock</span></figure><p>If you pull out an apple from your bag but don't have a knife on you to peel it, you're going to seem BIZARRE in Japan.</p><p>"My staff stared at me when I ate the skin on my apple," writes <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DJFiregirl</a>. "But they don't bat an eye at raw fish..." Another tourist shared his experience in Japan: "One time I went to that yearly thing at the Imperial Palace where the Emperor stands and waves to people. I had an apple as a snack, and going through security, they were very alarmed by this, asking 'Where's your knife!' I was confused until they clarified that, since I have an apple, it only stands to reason that I have a knife somewhere to peel it."</p><p>This practice is especially hilarious to me after reading about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">mch026</a>'s picnic: "We had bought food, including apples, at the grocery store on the way. We didn't have knives to cut our apples, so our Japanese friends weren't sure how to eat them."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">8. We're really loud.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock</span></figure><p>The most common complaint from foreigners who are visiting the other countries? "Why is everyone so loud in public?"</p><p>Once you get down to the nitty-gritty, though, it seems Americans are the real culprits here. "That's mostly Americans, you can hear them from miles away," responded <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Aethien</a>. Another non-Yankee added, "I think you guys have really bassy accents. TV doesn't show it well. Heard an American live and my ears shook for days."</p><p>Ouch. Some people came to America's defense, claiming not ALL Americans are guilty. "I'm an American who doesn't feel the need to project like a theater actor when I'm three feet away," wrote one guy, while a Dutch redditor chimed in to say "We Westerners are perhaps relatively loud ... but also a certain amount of Westerners are annoyed by publicly loud people, too."</p><p>These people should probably not set foot in South America, to be quite honest.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">9. American teenagers hang out too much.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: iStock</span></figure><p>My foreign mom never understood why I wanted to stay late at school if I didn't have some sort of club activity. Just sitting around with friends was never a good enough excuse, as that kind of hanging out was only something delinquents did back in her Latin American country.</p><p>Foreigners tend to side with my mom, it seems, much to the dismay of their American children. "I wasn't allowed to hang out with friends after school, because apparently in Japan only delinquents and idiots hang out after school," shared <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">clockworkswrong</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"Teenagers shouldn't be focusing on partying. [They should be] focused on getting better at school or club activities," added another. "Not being able to hang out after school was a pain and a hindrance to teenage social life!" they continued. "I do remember trying to convince my mother [that] 'all the other kids do it,' ... but she was adamant [that was] not 'normal' for a teenager, [even though it was] where we lived."</p><p>Sigh, I feel your pain.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">10. Work culture is really different.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: istock</span></figure><p>I realize a lot of expats must move from America to other countries for work, and vice versa, but after reading through this thread of cultural differences in the workplace, it's hard to understand how anyone can adjust.</p><p>For example, in Asia, wives don't work, so you'll stick out like a sore thumb if you're a mom with a 9-to-5. But for men, things are really shockingly different there as well.</p><p>Like, 9-to-5? More like, 9-to-whenever. Americans' "eagerness to leave the office on time" puts many people off in Japan, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">kurodon85</a>. They even have a term for this rudeness — "teiji dasshu" — and are always in shock when they come to the U.S. and see people actually leave their desk after sitting at it for eight hours.</p><p>Meanwhile, Europeans think Americans work too hard. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Danaldinho007</a> highlights this cultural norm: "I get 25 days paid leave as well as up to 10 days sick leave annually, as well as having the option to sacrifice a bit of my salary to get up to an extra 5 days annual leave. From what I hear, you Americans get nothing like this."</p><p>Ha! You hear correctly. Just typing out all those European work perks made me cringe.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">11. We are bad at sorting our trash.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: istock</span></figure><p>I can't think of how many times I've patted myself on the back just for properly disposing of my recycling, or how many times I've pulled out hair in frustration because I don't fully "get" what is supposed to get composted and what isn't.</p><p>In places like Japan, however, the trash sorting is truly next level.</p><p>"It depends on the city that you're living in, but in my city it goes something like this," explains <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">AsakiYumemiru</a>:&nbsp;</p>1) Flammable 2) Non-flammable 3) Non-flammable but with no organic waste on it (like plastic wrappings) 4) Cardboard/paper 5) Cloth 6) Aluminum Cans 7) Steel cans 8) Glass bottles (further sorted into transparent/other, green and brown bottles) 9) Batteries 10) Styrofoam trays/containers 11) Plastic trays/containers 12) Plastic bottles 13) Other miscellaneous items<p>No offense, but this is bananas.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">12. Learning costs money.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: istock</span></figure><p>This is an issue that truly grinds my gears as well, so I understand why it perplexes people who live abroad. "In some countries they pay students to go to college, or at least have free educations," says <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TunturiLoitsija</a>, so it really doesn't make much sense how much debt we as a country to into just to learn.</p><p>And although Americans are quick to defend their stance, saying that people flock from all over the world to study in our prestigious universities, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ammear</a> was quick to put them in their place: "While that is true, the majority of your population does not go to these universities. For overall development, it is better to have a well-educated majority population, than very well-educated significant minority. Not only does that improve economic growth, but also decreases social inequality (which, in turn, can further boost economic growth)."</p><p>*Drops mic*</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLKqvsNmmKadop6worqMoZiboaSo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fweird-american-habits.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fweird-american-habits.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fweird-american-habits.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fweird-american-habits.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fweird-american-habits.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fweird-american-habits.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./what-happened-between-morgan-and-binh-married-at-first-sight.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./what-happened-between-morgan-and-binh-married-at-first-sight.html>What Happened Between Morgan and Binh on 'Married at First Sight'??
