He lucked into the gig after being noticed by network execs while standing in for Chuck Woolery on "Wheel of Fortune," and the rest has been 36 years of history (and literature, and art, and a range of other categories).</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Production of the show <a href=#><u>has stalled</u></a> since March because of the coronavirus. While fans are disappointed, it may be a blessing for Alex, who is currently undergoing treatment for stage 4 pancreatic cancer.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite an incredibly difficult diagnosis, 79-year-old Alex remains optimistic and upbeat — and hasn’t given up his spot as the face of Jeopardy. Since he’s opened up about his battle with cancer, fans are more curious than ever about other aspects of his personal life, including who his current wife is — and <a href=#>who his ex-wife is</a> too!</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So, who is Alex Trebek's ex-wife?</h2><p>Alex’s first wife was Elaine Callei — or Elaine Trebek Kares, as she is known today — who he was married to from 1974 to 1981. Elaine is Nicky’s biological mother and her biological dad is Elaine’s former husband, Louis Callei.</p><p>Alex’s ex-wife was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reportedly</u></a> a Playboy bunny under the name Teddy Howard in the 1960s. She was also the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>host</u></a> of the daily talk show Call Callei, which aired out of Hamilton, Ontario. Elaine is American and was born in Ohio, but Alex is Canadian, and became a U.S. citizen in 1998.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Post-divorce from Alex, Elaine later went on to found ScentSeal, a company that packages perfume fragrances for sampling.</p><p>Today, she’s said to own <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Gallery GO</u></a> out of West Hollywood, which “is the newest addition to the La Cienega Design Quarter’s contemporary art scene offering a diverse collection of unique and ‘young’ contemporary art and photography, most often tied into musicians and super-stars.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">And Alex adopted Elaine's daughter decades ago.</h2><p>Alex and his current wife, Jean Trebek (formerly Jean Currivan), share two children of their own — Matthew (30) and Emily (27) but he was a father by way of adoption before he met Jean.</p><p>Nicky Trebek was 6 years old when her mom married Alex, and became his first child when he officially adopted her shortly thereafter.
