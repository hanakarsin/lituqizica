We learned that tiny Italian-American woman are referred to as meatballs, you should never skip gym/tan/laundry day, and please treat your partner with respect while in the smush room. It's the smush room we'd like to revisit for a moment as we look back on when Snooki first met her husband in the summer of 2010.</p><p>The air was thick with cologne and absolutely no sunscreen. After a day of doing not much, the gang headed to Karma where Snooki found herself in a drunken dance-off. His name was <a href=#>Jionni LaValle</a> but back in the smush room, Snooki called him Bernard. It's not because he presented as one but rather, she forgot his name. Smash (or smush) cut to over a decade later and the duo is <a href=#>married with children</a>. Sadly in 2015 his name was found on the Ashley Madison data breach list. Did Snooki's husband cheat?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Did Snooki's husband cheat on her? His name was found during the Ashley Madison hack.</h2><p>On August 15, 2015, a grenade was dropped on the dating world and we don't mean the kind popularized on Jersey Shore. A group of hackers known only as the Impact Team released the list of individuals who were found on Ashley Madison, a website for people looking to cheat. There were a few D-list celebrities found in the data breach. One of them was Jionni, but Snooki wasn't having it.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>, an email address matching Jionni's was used to sign up for an account though what happened beyond that was never shared. Snooki <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">took to Instagram on Aug. 25</a> to assure everyone her husband was not stepping out. She found out from her publicist that Jionni's name was mentioned and was sure to end up in the press. Initially, Snooki chose to ignore it because it "couldn't be further from the truth," but as the story got bigger, she felt compelled to address it.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Nicole "Snooki" ðŸ’‹ (@snooki)</a></p></figure><p>Snooki focused on the word allegedly, which is standard practice when reporting about situations like the data breach. For her that meant it couldn't be true. Beyond that, she mentioned how humble, loyal and respectful Jionni is. "I mean hello, that's why I married him," she wrote. The fact that he loves his family and is a standup guy somehow translates to not having an Ashley Madison account. For more on how one can be blindsided by cheating, look no further than <a href=#>Sam and Nia Rader</a>.</p><p>What seemed to bother Snooki more than feeling like the media is targeting her family, is the fact that Jionni might have paid to find someone to cheat on her with. "Honestly if he wanted to cheat, he would go out and do it," said Snooki. The message ends with Snooki telling her husband that she loves him.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">The hackers told the victims of the data breach to "move on and get over it."</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wired</a> reported that the Impact Team gave Avid Life Media, owner of AshleyMadison.com, the opportunity to take down the website before it released private information. When they didn't comply, a data dump 9.7 gigabytes in size was posted on the dark web. This included "account details and log-ins for some 32 million users of the social networking site."</p><p>Not only were the hackers chastising the users for what they considered immoral practices, but they were also sending a message to Avid Life Media. The company promised users they would delete their data for a $19 fee but that never happened. If they had followed through, the data breach would have been significantly smaller. "Too bad for those men, theyâ€™re cheating dirtbags and deserve no such discretion," wrote the hackers. "Too bad for ALM, you promised secrecy but didnâ€™t deliver."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfmbaledKnpqijmWK1tr%2FBmqWdZZOdsqLA</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdid-snooki-husband-cheat.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdid-snooki-husband-cheat.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdid-snooki-husband-cheat.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdid-snooki-husband-cheat.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdid-snooki-husband-cheat.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdid-snooki-husband-cheat.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./grant-wood-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./grant-wood-html.html>Grant Wood - Trivia, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./what-are-the-new-emojis-ios-17.html>What Are the New Emojis on iOS17?
