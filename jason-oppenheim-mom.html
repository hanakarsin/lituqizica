Jason and Brett Oppenheim’s mother, Deborah, makes an appearance during <a href=#>Selling Sunset</a> Season 5 and she's everything we would expect of Mama Oppenheim and then some.</p><p>In Episode 7, she's seen getting an early meal with Jason. She dons a colorful blouse and beaded necklace. As they sip on their morning champagne, they make small talk, and we learn that she's both a beauty and a beast.</p><p>“Monday was deadlift day,” she said, revealing that she lifted 195 pounds at the gym. Jason, feeling a tad inferior to his superior, credits her for lifting more than she does.</p><p>Then, Jason's <a href=#>now ex-girlfriend Chrishell Stause</a> joins them. Deborah, who Jason rarely introduces to others, is already talking about marriage and babies before any food has been eaten. Jason and Chrishell look extremely uncomfortable, but Deborah keeps going!</p><p>Who is this fearless woman?

Growing up, they<strong> </strong>were expelled or suspended from five schools. Deborah, who had gotten a divorce from their father Bennett, was their primary caretaker and had to handle this all by herself.</p><p>"Brett and I were incorrigible; very difficult to raise as we were intelligent, but argumentative and had huge antipathy towards authority," the Selling Sunset star told the outlet in 2020.</p><p>He explained that both he and Brett began drinking heavily at a young age and had spent nights in jail cells on several occasions. Deborah, who worked as a speech therapist, was trying her best to reprimand them while also trying to keep down a job.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram / @jasonoppenheim</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Deborah Oppenheim previously tricked Brett and Jason Oppenheim into attending a teen correctional camp.</h2><p>Dealing with two twin delinquents is hard, but Deborah had a couple tricks up her sleeve.</p><p>As Jason recalled, she sent him and Brett to "a basketball course" in Idaho, which actually turned out to be a teen correctional camp. "Mom worried that our aggression would escalate and wanted us out of her home after we’d fought with her boyfriend," he said.</p><p>The boys, who hailed from Fremont, Cali., were forced to march through the desert in army uniforms while at camp.</p><p>"There was no running water, showers, clothes changes, [or] bathroom tissue, and just a tin of lentils to eat daily. They took our shoes at night to stop us running away," he said, adding that he was so hungry that he ate half a rattlesnake while he was there.</p><p>However, the camp ultimately did nothing to rehabilitate the Oppenheim bros.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Jason Oppenheim (@jasonoppenheim)</a></p></figure><p>Fortunately, their father Bennett, who was a former Vietnam veteran, was able to talk some sense into them. He took them in and had them enroll in community college, where they excelled. From there, Jason and Brett went to UC Berkeley, became incredibly successful lawyers, and then made the pivot into real estate. What a miracle!</p><p>You can catch Mama Oppenheim on Selling Sunset Seasons 5, which is currently streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn660u81mpqmolaO1prXMZqSopQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjason-oppenheim-mom.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fjason-oppenheim-mom.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fjason-oppenheim-mom.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fjason-oppenheim-mom.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjason-oppenheim-mom.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjason-oppenheim-mom.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./big-brother-little-brother-first-date.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./big-brother-little-brother-first-date.html>This Guy Live-Tweeted His Little Brother's First Date And It's Too Pure</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./gigi-lazzarato-html.html>Gigi Gorgeous - Age, Family, Bio</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./gigi-lazzarato-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
