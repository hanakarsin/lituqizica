Sandra and Bryan have been together since 2015 and while they weren't married, they were very committed to each other and were co-parenting their collective three kids.</p><p>Our heart is breaking for Sandra and his family. Back in 2022, Sandra had even said that she was taking a break from the industry to be with her family, and it appears that now we know why that break was so pressing.</p><p>What was wrong with Bryan? We'll get to that. But first, let's take a walk down memory lane and go through Sandra and Bryan's relationship timeline.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Bryan Randall and Sandra Bullock's relationship timeline:</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Sandra and Bryan first met in January 2015 after Bryan photographed Sandra's son's birthday party.

The statement read:</p><p>"It is with great sadness that we share that on Aug. 5, Bryan Randall passed away peacefully after a three-year battle with ALS...Bryan chose early to keep his journey with ALS private and those of us who cared for him did our best to honor his request...We are immensely grateful to the tireless doctors who navigated the landscape of this illness with us and to the astounding nurses who became our roommates, often sacrificing their own families to be with ours... At this time we ask for privacy to grieve and to come to terms with the impossibility of saying goodbye to Bryan..."</p><p>Rest in peace, Bryan. Keeping Sandra and your family in our thoughts and prayers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7%2B6rc1mqZqmlJa5rXnSmqWdqpFir7a4y6iapGWimrmiwMiopaygmaV6tbXMnqOippU%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbryan-randall-sandra-bullock-relationship-timeline.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbryan-randall-sandra-bullock-relationship-timeline.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbryan-randall-sandra-bullock-relationship-timeline.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbryan-randall-sandra-bullock-relationship-timeline.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbryan-randall-sandra-bullock-relationship-timeline.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbryan-randall-sandra-bullock-relationship-timeline.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./many-reportedly-killed-houses-destroyed-as-okada-riders-clash-with-traders.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./many-reportedly-killed-houses-destroyed-as-okada-riders-clash-with-traders.html>Many Reportedly Killed, Houses Destroyed As Okada Riders Clash With Traders</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./sylvia-del-valle-html.html>Sylvia Del Valle - Edad, Familia, Biografa</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./sylvia-del-valle-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
