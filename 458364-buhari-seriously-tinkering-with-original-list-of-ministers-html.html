This is because the emergence of the officers of the National Assembly has affected the original list he has,”</i> the presidential source said.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;</strong><a href=#>GMB And Tinubu Disagree On Ministers, Transition Team?</a></p><p>“<i>Though he was expecting some elements of surprise in the election, but I think he never bargained for a total disregard to party directive in the election of the officers.”</i></p><p>After these conclusions of president only the South-South area has not promoted.</p><p>According to the source some people were disagreeing that since the National Chairman of the APC, Chief John Odigie-Oyegun, is from the zone, that should be believed as a position.</p><p>“<i>Because of this, the zone is being considered for a strategic position by the President either as the SGF, CoS or others. But politicians from the North-East are still mounting pressure on the President to cede the position of the SGF to the area,”</i> the insider added.</p><p>Lasun emergence is also said to be intimidating the zoning of the office of the Minister of Justice and the Attorney General of the Federation to the South-West.</p><p>It was said that Vice President Professor Yemi Osinbajo, was appointed with the responsibility of proposing a lawyer for the position.</p><p>Osinbajo will be in charge of justice and law reforms to be worked out by the Buhari government.</p><p>If those who want the position taken out of the zone succeed, it may go to Kebbi state, where a particular SAN who worked for the presidential ambition of Buhari and Osinbajo was being believed.</p><p>Meanwhile, the President has not made up his mind on this matter.</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:&nbsp;</strong><a href=#>Buhari’s Cabinet: List Of The Supposed Ministers</a></p><p>The name of a former Commissioner of Finance in Lagos state, Olawale Edun, was being advertised as one of the people to be nominated from the zone.</p><p>The problem in his appointment was reportedly that he was being nominated out of Ogun state where he is from with the intention of occupying the slot of his native state.</p><p>Meanwhile, the governor of Ogun state, Ibikunle Amosun, is fighting the move by supposedly saying he will be the one to appoint minister from his state.</p><p>Also being speculated as a minister is the Executive Chairman Lagos state Board of Internal Revenue and Chief Executive Officer Lagos state Internal Revenue Service, Babatunde Fowler.</p><p>Meanwhile, attempts made to get the respond to the story were not successful.</p><p>But a insider said that “<i>the non-appointment of some of the key aides of the President was because President Buhari was waiting for the elections at NASS.</i></p><p><i>“He didn’t want to make the mistake of appointing his aides from the zone where the leadership of both the Senate and the House of Representatives could have emerged.</i></p><p><i>“You know that the case of the South-East was particularly worrisome because they didn’t vote for the APC and they don’t have any senator or Rep from the APC. So, the way of taking care of the zone in key appointment was giving us headache.</i></p><p><i>“Now, the zone has come through the back door to get the office of the Deputy Senate President. That is okay for the Presidency. That shows the zone has helped itself and has also helped the Presidency</i>.”</p><p>Recent reports indicate that President Buhari, <a href=#>may have refused the leadership of his ruling party</a> in reaching decisions on ministerial nominations.</p><p>Meanwhile, Buhari has been in systematic considerations with the immediate former president, Goodluck Jonathan.</p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgXaEkm9rZpqlna6ztYysnKuhn6rArcWMraCno5Wntq%2BzjLCgraBdpL%2Bqs8inmKVlnJ7AtXnOn2SmoZ6ewLWx0axloaydoQ%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f458364-buhari-seriously-tinkering-with-original-list-of-ministers-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2f458364-buhari-seriously-tinkering-with-original-list-of-ministers-html.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2f458364-buhari-seriously-tinkering-with-original-list-of-ministers-html.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2f458364-buhari-seriously-tinkering-with-original-list-of-ministers-html.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f458364-buhari-seriously-tinkering-with-original-list-of-ministers-html.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2f458364-buhari-seriously-tinkering-with-original-list-of-ministers-html.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./where-is-wendell-jeffs-now.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./where-is-wendell-jeffs-now.html>Where Is Wendell Jeffs Now?
